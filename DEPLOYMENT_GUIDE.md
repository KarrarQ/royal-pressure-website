  // Replace YOUR_FORM_ID with your Formspree form ID
  const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {

    setFormData({ name: '', email: '', phone: '', serviceType: '', message: '' });
  }
};
