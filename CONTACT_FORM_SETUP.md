# 📧 Contact Form Email Setup Guide

## ✅ Contact Form is Ready!

The contact form is now configured to send emails to **Royalpressurellc25@gmail.com** when customers submit quote requests.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

I've integrated **Formspree** - a free service that handles form submissions and sends emails. Here's what happens:

1. Customer fills out the form on your website
2. They click "Get Free Quote"
3. Formspree receives the data
4. An email is sent to **Royalpressurellc25@gmail.com**
5. The email includes all form details:
   - Customer name
   - Email address
   - Phone number
   - Service type requested
   - Message
6. You can reply directly to the customer's email

### Step 3: Get Your Form Endpoint

After creating the form, you'll see a form endpoint that looks like:
```

```

Copy this endpoint URL.

### Step 4: Update the Contact Form Code

1. Open `src/components/Contact.jsx`
2. Find this line (around line 28):
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/xanydeop', {
   ```
3. Replace `xanydeop` with your actual form ID
4. Save the file

**That's it!** The form will now send emails to Royalpressurellc25@gmail.com.
